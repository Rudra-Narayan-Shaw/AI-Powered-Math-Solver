## üöÄ Overview

**AI-Powered-Math-Solver** bridges the gap between flexible math input (typed, scanned, or handwritten) and deep conceptual understanding. By fusing advanced OCR, symbolic computation, and large language models, it delivers:

- Stepwise, human-like explanations
- Graphical visualizations
- Practice problem generation
- Intuitive, modern UI

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Hybrid Input:** Accepts both typed math and image uploads (handwritten or printed).
- **Cutting-Edge OCR:** Leverages Pix2Text and other models for robust recognition.
- **Symbolic Computation:** Solves linear and polynomial equations via SymPy.
- **Stepwise Explanations:** Breaks down each step with natural language and LaTeX.

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Plots equations, roots, and solution steps.
- **Practice Generator:** Creates similar problems for self-study.
- **Web App:** Clean, responsive interface built with Gradio.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/AI-Powered-Math-Solver.git
cd AI-Powered-Math-Solver
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will launch in your browser with a Gradio interface.

## üí° How to Use

- **Typed Input:** Enter equations directly in the text box.
- **Image Input:** Upload a photo or scan of handwritten/printed equations.
- **View Solutions:** Explore stepwise explanations, symbolic steps, and interactive graphs.
- **Practice:** Generate new, similar problems for extra learning.

## üß© Example Inputs & Outputs

### Example 1: Typed Input

**Input:**  
`2x + 3y = 7, 4x - y = 5`

**Output:**  
- Stepwise symbolic solution for the system
- Natural language explanation for each step
- Graph showing intersection point

### Example 2: Image Input

**Input:**  
Upload a photo of a handwritten quadratic equation.

**Output:**  
- OCR extracts the equation
- Stepwise solution with LaTeX formatting
- Explanation referencing relevant theorems
- Plot of the quadratic with roots highlighted
